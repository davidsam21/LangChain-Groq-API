```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

header {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
}

h1 {
    color: #333;
    margin: 0;
}
```
Note: I've used a simple and clean design for the HTML and CSS, assuming that's what you're looking for. If you have any specific requirements or design preferences, please let me know and I'll be happy to adjust the code accordingly.
